<h1>Subject of study</h1>
<p>At the univeristy, we have a pretty open-minded research facility-as long as the subjects<br> fall somewhere in the real of science and technology.You seem like an intelligent,dedicted<br> research,and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team .Saying that, of the idea<br> you submitted wee were most intrigued by are as follows,in order of priority.</p><br>
<p>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine,and the health benefit of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<br>Measuring the effect on performance of funnk bassplayer at temperatures exceeding30<sup>o</sup>C(86<sup>0</sup>F<br>when the audience size exponentially increases(effect of 3</p><br>

<p>So please can you provide more informaton on each of these subjects, including how long you'd<br> expect the research to take,required staff and other resources,and anything else you think we'd <br>need to know?Thanks.</p>
<h2><strong>Exotic dance moves</strong></h2>
<p>Yes,you are right! As psrt of my post-doctorate work,I did study exotic tribal dances. To<br> answer your question, my favorite dances are as follows, with definition:</p>


 <dl>
       <dt>Polynesian chichen dance</dt>
<dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as <b>300BC</b>, a whole village<br> will dance around in a circle like chicken, to encourage their livestock to be <q>fruitful</q></dd>
 .</dl>
  <dt> Iceland brownian shuffle,</dt>
  <dd>Before the icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice<br>this dance, which involve huddling close together on the floor and shuffling<br>their bodies around imperceptibly timing, very rapid movements. One of my fellow<br> student used to say that he thought his dance inspired modern styles such as twerking.</dd><br><dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
  <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960<sub>s </sub><br>believe to have discover a new dance style charaterized by <q>robotic</q>, stilted<br> movements, being practiced by imhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on<br> however it was discover that they were just moving like this because they were really<br>cold.</dd>
<br>
